## Instructions to Resume

1. **Start Docker for Environments**:

    ```bash
    # Make sure Docker Desktop is running
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. **Verify Environments**:

    ```bash
    # Test staging environment
    curl http://localhost:3001/

    # Test production environment
    curl http://localhost:3002/
    ```

3. **Make Additional Changes**:

    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    # Make changes to files
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update for testing full pipeline"
    git push origin dev
    ```

4. **Create Pull Request**:

    - Go to GitHub repository
    - Create pull request from dev to main
    - Review and merge

5. **Monitor Pipeline Execution**:
    - Check Jenkins for build triggered by main branch
    - Verify all stages including production deployment

## Final Steps
